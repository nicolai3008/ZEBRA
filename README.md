# ZEBRA software

This is a compilation of software created for the ZEBRA instrument at PSI. These softwares are meant to be run on a neutron single crystal instrument using the nicos operating system. The list of current software is:
- PyRefine
-   A UB Matrix Refinement algorithm for Normal Beam, Eulerian Cradle and Kappa Geometries
-   Works for NB and Euler geometry on any single crystal instrument
- XYZ
-   Calculation from two Friedel Reflection Pairs to figure out displacement of sample

Future software under development:
- Incommensorate reflection: Calculation of propogation vector
- Full angular space resolution function and automated reflection calculation

This project is done in collaboration with Romain Sibille at PSI. For any questions or requests, please write to nicolai.amin@psi.ch
